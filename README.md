# Bootstrap V4 Affinity Designer Files
A collection of Affinity Designer files and templates for use on Bootstrap V4 projects

## Importing the Colour Palettes
To import the colour palettes please follow the steps below:

  1) Download the **Bootstrap V4 Theme Colours.afpalette** file.
  2) Open Affinity Designer and in your **Swatches** panel, click the menu icon in the upper right corner.
  3) At the bottom of the dropdown menu there is an option to **Import Palette**, hover this option and choose whether you would like to import *As Application Palette* (will be accessible within every `.afdesign` file you open) or *As Document Palette* (will ONLY be accessible within the `.afdesign` file you imported the palette into).
  
If the above has gone correctly you will now have access to all the default V4 Bootstrap Theme Colours from the select dropdown in your swatches panel.
